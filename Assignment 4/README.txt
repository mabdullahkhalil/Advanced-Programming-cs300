Working of the game: 

the client conencts to the server.
it waits until the new client joins in.
i have made objects that store game number along with the array containing both the players.
first player to join in starts the game.
on click it send the id, i.e. the row and column of the grid. 
server checks and marks the color and assigns yellow to it. 
then the next player moves in with th same thing.
after every move, it checks for the win condition. on every hover it checks for the green on red column.

you can join as many clients as you want. 

limitations:
i have commented out code for hovering at the time of submission. will come in office hours, it might be the browser issue that ain;t handling it.
